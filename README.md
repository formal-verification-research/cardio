# Cardio: an efficient probabilistic model checker written in Rust.

Cardio aims to be a probabilistic model checking engine for deterministic Markov chains, i.e., CTMCs and DTMCs, written in Rust and eventually verified using [Kani](https://github.com/model-checking/kani) and/or [Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus). Using Rust best-practice, Cardio wishes to be:

- modular
- efficient
- fast
- customizable

We would like Cardio to be competitive in speed to [Storm](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm).

## Features

- [ ] CSL and PCTL parsing (in progress--mostly finished)
- [x] Rewards
- [ ] Transient analysis (in progress)
- [ ] Steady State Analysis (planned)

...and more.
